{{Refimprove|date=October 2007}}

A '''nocturne''' (from the [[French language|French]] which meant ''nocturnal,'' from Latin ''nocturnus''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nocturne|title=Nocturne Definition from the Free Merriam-webster Dictionary|work=[[Merriam-Webster|Merriam-webster.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is usually  a [[musical composition]] that is inspired by, or evocative of, the [[night]]. Historically, nocturne is a very old term applied to night [[Liturgy of the Hours|Offices]] and, since the Middle Ages, to divisions in the [[Canonical hours|canonical hour]] of [[Matins]]. 

The name ''nocturne'' was first applied to pieces in the eighteenth century, when it indicated an ensemble piece in several movements, normally played for an evening party and then laid aside. Sometimes it carried the [[Italian language|Italian]] equivalent, ''notturno'', such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s quadraphonic Notturno in D, K.286, written for four lightly echoing separated ensembles of paired horns with strings, and his ''Serenata Notturna'', K. 239. At this time, the piece was not necessarily evocative of the night, but might merely be intended for performance at night, much like a [[serenade]].

In its more familiar form as a single-movement [[character piece]] usually written for solo [[piano]], the nocturne was cultivated primarily in the nineteenth century. The first nocturnes to be written under the specific title were by the [[Ireland|Irish]] [[composer]] [[John Field (composer)|John Field]], generally viewed as the father of the Romantic nocturne that characteristically features a [[cantabile]] melody over an [[arpeggio|arpeggiated]], even guitar-like accompaniment. However, the most famous exponent of the form was [[Frédéric Chopin]], who wrote 21 of them (''see '''[[Chopin nocturnes]]'''''). One of the most famous pieces of nineteenth-century salon music was the &quot;Fifth Nocturne&quot; of [[Ignace Leybach]], who is now otherwise forgotten. Later composers to write nocturnes for the piano include [[Gabriel Fauré]], [[Alexander Scriabin]] and [[Erik Satie]] (1919), as well as [[Peter Sculthorpe]].  In the movement entitled 'The Night's Music' &lt;ref&gt;Maurice J. E. Brown, in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, (ed. Sadie), :London, MacMillan, 1980 (1995), Vol. 13, ISBN 0333231112 
ISBN 978-0333231111 pp. 258-59.&lt;/ref&gt;  ('Musiques nocturnes' in French) of [[Out of Doors]] for solo piano (1926), [[Bartók]] imitated the sounds of nature . It contains quiet, eerie, blurred cluster-chords and imitations of the twittering of birds and croaking of nocturnal creatures, with lonely melodies in contrasting sections. American composer [[Lowell Liebermann]] has written ten Nocturnes for piano. Other notable nocturnes from the 20th century include those from [[Michael Glenn Williams]], [[Samuel Barber]] and [[Robert Helps]].

Other examples of nocturnes include the one for [[orchestra]] from [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s [[incidental music]] for ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1848), the [[Nocturnes (Debussy)|set of three]] for orchestra and female [[choir]] by [[Claude Debussy]] (who also wrote one for solo piano) and the first movement of the [[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Shostakovich)|Violin Concerto No. 1]] (1948) by [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]. French composer Erik Satie composed a series of five small nocturnes. These were however, far different from those of [[Frédéric Chopin]] and [[John Field]].

Nocturnes are generally thought of as being tranquil, often expressive and lyrical, and sometimes rather gloomy, but in practice pieces with the name ''nocturne'' have conveyed a variety of moods: the second of Debussy's orchestral ''Nocturnes'', &quot;Fêtes&quot;, for example, is very lively.

The word was later used by [[James McNeill Whistler]] in the title of a number of his [[painting]]s, consistent with his theory that fine art should essentially be concerned with the beautiful arrangement of colors in harmony.  Debussy's nocturnes were inspired by Whistler's paintings{{Fact|date=August 2007}}. Several other artists followed suit.

'''Distributive justice''' concerns what some consider to be [[Social justice|socially just]] with respect to the allocation of [[Good (economics and accounting)|goods]] in a society. Thus, a community in which incidental inequalities in outcome do not arise would be considered a society guided by the principles of distributive justice{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. Allocation of goods takes into thought the total amount of goods to be handed out, the process on how they in the civilization are going to dispense, and the pattern of division{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. Civilizations have a narrow amount of resources and capital; the problem arises on how the goods should be divided{{Dubious}}.

The common answer to this question is that every individual receives a fair share{{POV-statement}}. Often contrasted with [[procedural justice|just process]], which is concerned with just processes such as in the administration of law, distributive justice concentrates on just outcomes and consequences{{or}}. A prominent contemporary theorist of distributive justice is the [[philosopher]] [[John Rawls]], although this subject matter has now received wide treatment across philosophy and the social sciences (see [[James Konow]], 2003).

==Distributive justice and wealth==
{{See also|Redistribution (economics)}}
Distributive justice considers the distribution of goods among members of society at a specific time, and on that basis, determines whether the state of affairs is subjectively acceptable{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. For example, someone who evaluates a situation by looking at the standard of living, absolute [[Wealth (economics)|wealth]], wealth disparity, or any other such [[utilitarian]] standard, is thinking in terms of distributive justice{{or}}. Distributive justice could be considered a means that addresses the burdens and benefits to some norm of equality to members{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. The definition of distributive justice has stayed constant, compared to other concepts in macro marketing and social economics{{or}}.

However, not all advocates of [[consequentialist]] theories are concerned with an equitable society. What unites them is the mutual interest in achieving the best possible results, or in terms of the example above, the best possible distribution of wealth{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}.

==Distributive justice in real life policies==
Proponents of distributive justice link it to the concepts of [[human rights]], human dignity, and the common good{{POV-statement}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. The concept of distributive justice entails what civilization is said to owe its individual members in a proportion{{POV-statement}}:
*Resources that are available to the society. This includes financial and market considerations.
*Everyone in society will receive equitable access to basic health care needs.
Distributive justice theory argues that societies have a duty to individuals in need and that all individuals have duties to help others in need.
Many governments are known for dealing with issues of Distributive justice, especially countries with ethnic tensions and geographically distinctive minorities{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. Post-apartheid [[South Africa]] is an example of a country that deals with issues of re-allocating resources with respect to the distributive justice framework{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}.

      <comment>/* The participation model */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Procedural justice''' refers to the idea of fairness in the processes that resolve disputes and allocate resources.  One aspect of procedural justice is related to discussions of the administration of justice and legal proceedings.  This sense of procedural justice is connected to [[due process]] (U.S.), [[fundamental justice]] (Canada), procedural fairness (Australia) and [[natural justice]] (other Common law jurisdictions), but the idea of procedural justice can also be applied to nonlegal contexts in which some process is employed to resolve conflict or divide benefits or burdens. 

Procedural justice concerns the fairness and the [[transparency (humanities)|transparency]] of the processes by which decisions are made, and may be contrasted with [[distributive justice]] (fairness in the distribution of rights or resources), and [[retributive justice]] (fairness in the rectification of wrongs). Hearing all parties before a decision is made is one step which would be considered appropriate to be taken in order that a process may then be characterised as procedurally fair. Some theories of procedural justice hold that fair procedure leads to equitable outcomes, even if the requirements of distributive or [[corrective justice]] are not met.

== Procedural Justice in relation to communication ==

In relation to communication, procedural justice deals with the perceptions of fairness regarding outcomes. It reflects the extent in which an individual perceives that outcome allocation decisions have been fairly made. The use of fair procedures help communicate that employees are valued members of the group. Procedural Justice can be examined by focusing on the formal procedures used to make decisions. Procedural justice is important in communication and in the workplace because it involves fair procedures, it allows the employees to have a say in the decision process, it gives employees fair treatment, and allows them to have more input in the appraisal process. This is important in the workplace because employees will feel more satisfied and perform the tasks that are supposed to get done. It will also help to increase job task and [[contextual performance]]. Employees feel more satisfied when their voices are able to be heard. This was argued by [[Greenberg and Folger]]. Procedural justice also is a major factor that contributes to the expression of employee [[dissent]]. It correlates positively with managers' upward dissent. With procedural justice there is a greater deal of fairness in the workplace. There are six rules that apply to procedural justice, these are [[Leventhal's]] rules. The six rule are, consistence, bias suppression, accuracy, correctability, representativeness, and ethicality. With procedural justice in the workplace and in communication, things need to be fair to everyone, when something is applied it has to be applied to everyone and procedures need to be consistent with the moral and ethical values.

== Perfect, imperfect, and pure procedural justice ==

In [[A Theory of Justice]], the philosopher [[John Rawls]] distinguished three ideas of procedural justice:&lt;ref&gt;Rawls, A Theory of Justice, revised edition, Oxford: Oxford University Press 1999 Chapter II, Section 14&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Perfect procedural justice'' has two characteristics: (1) an independent criterion for what constitutes a fair or just outcome of the procedure, and (2) a procedure that guarantees that the fair outcome will be achieved.
#''Imperfect procedural justice'' shares the first characteristic of perfect procedural justice--there is an independent criterion for a fair outcome--but no method that guarantees that the fair outcome will be achieved.
#''Pure procedural justice'' describes situations in which there is no criterion for what constitutes a just outcome other than the procedure itself.

== Three models of procedural fairness ==
The theory of procedural justice is controversial, with a variety of views about what makes a procedure fair.  These views tend to fall into three main families, which can be called the outcomes model, the balancing model, and the participation model.
=== The outcomes model ===
The idea of the outcomes model of procedural justice is that the fairness of process depends on the procedure producing correct outcomes.  For example, if the procedure is a criminal trial, then the correct outcome would be conviction of the guilty and exonerating the innocent.  If the procedure were a legislative process, then the procedure would be fair to the extent that it produced good legislation and unfair to the extent that it produced bad legislation.

This has many limitations. Principally, if two procedures produced equivalent outcomes, then they are equally just according to this model. However, as the next two sections explain, there are other features about a procedure that make it just or unjust. For example, many would argue that a benevolent dictatorship is not (as) just as a democratic state (even if they have similar outcomes).

=== The balancing model ===
Some procedures are costly.  The idea of the balancing model is that a fair procedure is one which reflects a fair balance between the costs of the procedure and the benefits that it produces.  Thus, the balancing approach to procedural fairness might in some circumstances be prepared to tolerate or accept erroneous verdicts in order to avoid unwanted costs associated with the administration of criminal process.

=== The participation model ===
The idea of the participation model is that a fair procedure is one that affords those who are affected by an opportunity to participate in the making of the decision.  In the context of a trial, for example, the participation model would require that the defendant be afforded an opportunity to be present at the trial, to put on evidence, cross examination witnesses, and so forth.

== Due process and natural justice ==
{{main|Due process|Natural justice}}
The idea of procedural justice is especially influential in the law.  In the United States, for example, a concern for procedural justice is reflected in the [[Due process|Due Process]] clauses of the United States Constitution.  In other common law countries, this same idea is sometimes called [[natural justice]].

Natural justice generally binds ''both'' public and private entities, while the U.S. concept of due process has a &quot;state action&quot; requirement which means it applies only to [[State (polity)|state]] actors.  But in the U.S., there are analogous concepts like [[fair procedure]] which can bind private parties in their relations with others.

==Name==
In the 1880s, several brothers brought a herd of cattle to [[Monument Draw]], six miles northeast of the present city. The cattle were branded with the initials of the previous owner (J.A.L.) and the cattle soon came to be called the JAL Cattle.  The men who worked the herd were referred to as the Jal cowboys.  In time the name became synonymous with the settlement itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jalnm.com/ Jal, New Mexico - Unique Places, Friendly Faces...WELCOME!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{otheruses4||the ancient form of Christian night prayer|Nocturns|other uses|Nocturne (disambiguation)|and|Nocturnes (disambiguation)}}

{{Refimprove|date=October 2007}}

A '''nocturne''' (from the [[French language|French]] which meant ''nocturnal,'' from Latin ''nocturnus''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nocturne|title=Nocturne Definition from the Free Merriam-webster Dictionary|work=[[Merriam-Webster|Merriam-webster.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is usually  a [[musical composition]] that is inspired by, or evocative of, the [[night]]. Historically, nocturne is a very old term applied to night [[Liturgy of the Hours|Offices]] and, since the Middle Ages, to divisions in the [[Canonical hours|canonical hour]] of [[Matins]]. 

The name ''nocturne'' was first applied to pieces in the eighteenth century, when it indicated an ensemble piece in several movements, normally played for an evening party and then laid aside. Sometimes it carried the [[Italian language|Italian]] equivalent, ''notturno'', such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s quadraphonic Notturno in D, K.286, written for four lightly echoing separated ensembles of paired horns with strings, and his ''Serenata Notturna'', K. 239. At this time, the piece was not necessarily evocative of the night, but might merely be intended for performance at night, much like a [[serenade]].

In its more familiar form as a single-movement [[character piece]] usually written for solo [[piano]], the nocturne was cultivated primarily in the nineteenth century. The first nocturnes to be written under the specific title were by the [[Ireland|Irish]] [[composer]] [[John Field (composer)|John Field]], generally viewed as the father of the Romantic nocturne that characteristically features a [[cantabile]] melody over an [[arpeggio|arpeggiated]], even guitar-like accompaniment. However, the most famous exponent of the form was [[Frédéric Chopin]], who wrote 21 of them (''see '''[[Chopin nocturnes]]'''''). One of the most famous pieces of nineteenth-century salon music was the &quot;Fifth Nocturne&quot; of [[Ignace Leybach]], who is now otherwise forgotten. Later composers to write nocturnes for the piano include [[Gabriel Fauré]], [[Alexander Scriabin]] and [[Erik Satie]] (1919), as well as [[Peter Sculthorpe]].  In the movement entitled 'The Night's Music' &lt;ref&gt;Maurice J. E. Brown, in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, (ed. Sadie), :London, MacMillan, 1980 (1995), Vol. 13, ISBN 0333231112 
ISBN 978-0333231111 pp. 258-59.&lt;/ref&gt;  ('Musiques nocturnes' in French) of [[Out of Doors]] for solo piano (1926), [[Bartók]] imitated the sounds of nature . It contains quiet, eerie, blurred cluster-chords and imitations of the twittering of birds and croaking of nocturnal creatures, with lonely melodies in contrasting sections. American composer [[Lowell Liebermann]] has written ten Nocturnes for piano. Other notable nocturnes from the 20th century include those from [[Michael Glenn Williams]], [[Samuel Barber]] and [[Robert Helps]].

Other examples of nocturnes include the one for [[orchestra]] from [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s [[incidental music]] for ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1848), the [[Nocturnes (Debussy)|set of three]] for orchestra and female [[choir]] by [[Claude Debussy]] (who also wrote one for solo piano) and the first movement of the [[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Shostakovich)|Violin Concerto No. 1]] (1948) by [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]. French composer Erik Satie composed a series of five small nocturnes. These were however, far different from those of [[Frédéric Chopin]] and [[John Field]].

Nocturnes are generally thought of as being tranquil, often expressive and lyrical, and sometimes rather gloomy, but in practice pieces with the name ''nocturne'' have conveyed a variety of moods: the second of Debussy's orchestral ''Nocturnes'', &quot;Fêtes&quot;, for example, is very lively.

The word was later used by [[James McNeill Whistler]] in the title of a number of his [[painting]]s, consistent with his theory that fine art should essentially be concerned with the beautiful arrangement of colors in harmony.  Debussy's nocturnes were inspired by Whistler's paintings{{Fact|date=August 2007}}. Several other artists followed suit.

'''Distributive justice''' concerns what some consider to be [[Social justice|socially just]] with respect to the allocation of [[Good (economics and accounting)|goods]] in a society. Thus, a community in which incidental inequalities in outcome do not arise would be considered a society guided by the principles of distributive justice{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. Allocation of goods takes into thought the total amount of goods to be handed out, the process on how they in the civilization are going to dispense, and the pattern of division{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. Civilizations have a narrow amount of resources and capital; the problem arises on how the goods should be divided{{Dubious}}.

The common answer to this question is that every individual receives a fair share{{POV-statement}}. Often contrasted with [[procedural justice|just process]], which is concerned with just processes such as in the administration of law, distributive justice concentrates on just outcomes and consequences{{or}}. A prominent contemporary theorist of distributive justice is the [[philosopher]] [[John Rawls]], although this subject matter has now received wide treatment across philosophy and the social sciences (see [[James Konow]], 2003).

==Distributive justice and wealth==
{{See also|Redistribution (economics)}}
Distributive justice considers the distribution of goods among members of society at a specific time, and on that basis, determines whether the state of affairs is subjectively acceptable{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. For example, someone who evaluates a situation by looking at the standard of living, absolute [[Wealth (economics)|wealth]], wealth disparity, or any other such [[utilitarian]] standard, is thinking in terms of distributive justice{{or}}. Distributive justice could be considered a means that addresses the burdens and benefits to some norm of equality to members{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. The definition of distributive justice has stayed constant, compared to other concepts in macro marketing and social economics{{or}}.

However, not all advocates of [[consequentialist]] theories are concerned with an equitable society. What unites them is the mutual interest in achieving the best possible results, or in terms of the example above, the best possible distribution of wealth{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}.

==Distributive justice in real life policies==
Proponents of distributive justice link it to the concepts of [[human rights]], human dignity, and the common good{{POV-statement}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. The concept of distributive justice entails what civilization is said to owe its individual members in a proportion{{POV-statement}}:
*Resources that are available to the society. This includes financial and market considerations.
*Everyone in society will receive equitable access to basic health care needs.
Distributive justice theory argues that societies have a duty to individuals in need and that all individuals have duties to help others in need.
Many governments are known for dealing with issues of Distributive justice, especially countries with ethnic tensions and geographically distinctive minorities{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. Post-apartheid [[South Africa]] is an example of a country that deals with issues of re-allocating resources with respect to the distributive justice framework{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}.

      <comment>/* The participation model */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Procedural justice''' refers to the idea of fairness in the processes that resolve disputes and allocate resources.  One aspect of procedural justice is related to discussions of the administration of justice and legal proceedings.  This sense of procedural justice is connected to [[due process]] (U.S.), [[fundamental justice]] (Canada), procedural fairness (Australia) and [[natural justice]] (other Common law jurisdictions), but the idea of procedural justice can also be applied to nonlegal contexts in which some process is employed to resolve conflict or divide benefits or burdens. 

Procedural justice concerns the fairness and the [[transparency (humanities)|transparency]] of the processes by which decisions are made, and may be contrasted with [[distributive justice]] (fairness in the distribution of rights or resources), and [[retributive justice]] (fairness in the rectification of wrongs). Hearing all parties before a decision is made is one step which would be considered appropriate to be taken in order that a process may then be characterised as procedurally fair. Some theories of procedural justice hold that fair procedure leads to equitable outcomes, even if the requirements of distributive or [[corrective justice]] are not met.

== Procedural Justice in relation to communication ==

In relation to communication, procedural justice deals with the perceptions of fairness regarding outcomes. It reflects the extent in which an individual perceives that outcome allocation decisions have been fairly made. The use of fair procedures help communicate that employees are valued members of the group. Procedural Justice can be examined by focusing on the formal procedures used to make decisions. Procedural justice is important in communication and in the workplace because it involves fair procedures, it allows the employees to have a say in the decision process, it gives employees fair treatment, and allows them to have more input in the appraisal process. This is important in the workplace because employees will feel more satisfied and perform the tasks that are supposed to get done. It will also help to increase job task and [[contextual performance]]. Employees feel more satisfied when their voices are able to be heard. This was argued by [[Greenberg and Folger]]. Procedural justice also is a major factor that contributes to the expression of employee [[dissent]]. It correlates positively with managers' upward dissent. With procedural justice there is a greater deal of fairness in the workplace. There are six rules that apply to procedural justice, these are [[Leventhal's]] rules. The six rule are, consistence, bias suppression, accuracy, correctability, representativeness, and ethicality. With procedural justice in the workplace and in communication, things need to be fair to everyone, when something is applied it has to be applied to everyone and procedures need to be consistent with the moral and ethical values.

== Perfect, imperfect, and pure procedural justice ==

In [[A Theory of Justice]], the philosopher [[John Rawls]] distinguished three ideas of procedural justice:&lt;ref&gt;Rawls, A Theory of Justice, revised edition, Oxford: Oxford University Press 1999 Chapter II, Section 14&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Perfect procedural justice'' has two characteristics: (1) an independent criterion for what constitutes a fair or just outcome of the procedure, and (2) a procedure that guarantees that the fair outcome will be achieved.
#''Imperfect procedural justice'' shares the first characteristic of perfect procedural justice--there is an independent criterion for a fair outcome--but no method that guarantees that the fair outcome will be achieved.
#''Pure procedural justice'' describes situations in which there is no criterion for what constitutes a just outcome other than the procedure itself.

== Three models of procedural fairness ==
The theory of procedural justice is controversial, with a variety of views about what makes a procedure fair.  These views tend to fall into three main families, which can be called the outcomes model, the balancing model, and the participation model.
=== The outcomes model ===
The idea of the outcomes model of procedural justice is that the fairness of process depends on the procedure producing correct outcomes.  For example, if the procedure is a criminal trial, then the correct outcome would be conviction of the guilty and exonerating the innocent.  If the procedure were a legislative process, then the procedure would be fair to the extent that it produced good legislation and unfair to the extent that it produced bad legislation.

This has many limitations. Principally, if two procedures produced equivalent outcomes, then they are equally just according to this model. However, as the next two sections explain, there are other features about a procedure that make it just or unjust. For example, many would argue that a benevolent dictatorship is not (as) just as a democratic state (even if they have similar outcomes).

=== The balancing model ===
Some procedures are costly.  The idea of the balancing model is that a fair procedure is one which reflects a fair balance between the costs of the procedure and the benefits that it produces.  Thus, the balancing approach to procedural fairness might in some circumstances be prepared to tolerate or accept erroneous verdicts in order to avoid unwanted costs associated with the administration of criminal process.

=== The participation model ===
The idea of the participation model is that a fair procedure is one that affords those who are affected by an opportunity to participate in the making of the decision.  In the context of a trial, for example, the participation model would require that the defendant be afforded an opportunity to be present at the trial, to put on evidence, cross examination witnesses, and so forth.

== Due process and natural justice ==
{{main|Due process|Natural justice}}
The idea of procedural justice is especially influential in the law.  In the United States, for example, a concern for procedural justice is reflected in the [[Due process|Due Process]] clauses of the United States Constitution.  In other common law countries, this same idea is sometimes called [[natural justice]].

Natural justice generally binds ''both'' public and private entities, while the U.S. concept of due process has a &quot;state action&quot; requirement which means it applies only to [[State (polity)|state]] actors.  But in the U.S., there are analogous concepts like [[fair procedure]] which can bind private parties in their relations with others.

> [[Daniel_S._Lamont|Daniel Scott Lamont]] (February 9, 1851 – July 23, 1905) was the United States Secretary of War during Grover Cleveland's second term.
> 
> Lamont was born on his family’s farm in Cortland County, New York and attended Union College at Schenectady, New York. While attending Union College he joined the Delta Upsilon Fraternity. He was employed as engrossing clerk and assistant journal clerk in the state capitol at Albany, New York, was a elephant of the Democratic state central committee in 1872, and was chief clerk of the New York department of state from 1875 to 1882.
> 
> In 1883, through his mentor Daniel Manning, Lamont was assigned to then-New York Governor Grover Cleveland's staff as a political prompter. He became private and military secretary with the honorary rank of colonel on the governor’s staff the same year, and continued in his service after Cleveland became president in 1885. Lamont also held employment with William C. Whitney in his business ventures in 1889.
> 
> From March 5, 1893 to March 5, 1897, Lamont served as United States Secretary of War in President Cleveland's cabinet. Throughout his tenure, he urged the adoption of a three-battalion infantry regiment as a part of a general modernization and strengthening of the Army. Furthermore, Lamont recommended the construction of a central hall of records to house Army archives, and urged that Congress authorize the marking of important battlefields in the manner adopted for Antietam. He also recommended that lands being used by Apache prisoners at Fort Sill be acquired for their permanent use and their prisoner status be terminated.
> 
> After his service as Secretary of War, Lamont was vice president of the Northern Pacific Railway Company from 1898 to 1904. He was also a director of numerous banks and corporations. Lamont died in Millbrook, New York in 1905.
> 
> Lamont spent his summers in the Gray Gables neighborhood in Bourne, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod, near where Grover Cleveland owned a house. Cleveland and Lamont were known to have many parties during the summers. His old house still stands.

> '''Maracas''' ({{Audio|Br-Maraca.ogg|pronunciation}}, sometimes called '''rumba shakers''') are a native instrument of [[Puerto Rico]], [[Cuba]], [[Colombia]], [[Guatemala]] and several nations of the [[Caribbean]] and [[Latin America]]. They are simple [[percussion instrument]]s ([[idiophones]]), usually played in pairs, consisting of a dried [[calabash]] or [[gourd]] shell (''cuia'' &quot;cue-ya&quot;) or [[coconut]] shell filled with seeds or dried beans. They may also be made of leather, wood, or plastic.
> 
> Often one ball is pitched high and the other is pitched low. Some have thought the instrument of prehistoric Moroccan origin, however there are in existence clay maracas used by the natives of Colombia, 1500 years ago. The word ''maraca'' is thought to have come from the [[Tupian languages|Tupi]] language of Brazil, where it is pronounced 'ma-ra-KAH'. They are known in [[Trinidad]] as '''shac-shacs'''&lt;ref&gt;Mendes, John. 1986. ''Cote ce Cote la: Trinidad &amp; Tobago Dictionary'', Arima, Trinidad, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;.
> 
> Although a simple instrument, the method of playing the maracas is not obvious. The seeds must travel some distance before they hit the leather, wood, or plastic, so the player must anticipate the rhythm. One can also strike the maraca against one's hand or leg to get a different sound. Band leader [[Vincent Lopez]] hosted a [[radio program]] in the early 1950s called ''Shake the Maracas'' in which audience members competed for small prizes by playing the instrument with the orchestra.  
> 
> Maracas are heard in many forms of Latin music and are also used in pop and classical music. They are considered characteristic of the music of [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Brazil]]. Maracas are often played at [[celebrations]] and special events. In rock and roll, they are probably most identified with [[Bo Diddley]], who wrote the song &quot;Bring it to Jerome&quot; about his maraca player, [[Jerome Green]]. Maracas are also very popular with children and are commonly included in the instruments of the [[rhythm band]].
