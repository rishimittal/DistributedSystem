This assignment involves changes to the client to make it handle a failure of the FileServer.

We will build on assignments 2 and 3 for this.

In this assignment, the client should handle errors/exceptions while reading from a FileServer.

The registry and all instances of FileServer should be first started. Once all FileServers are started, kill 1 or more (not all). 

Then, the multi-threaded FileClient will be launched to read a large file. The threads that are reading from the FileServer instances that are down will get errors. The client has to recover from these errors by stopping this thread.

The other threads will continue reading the file completely by reading different chunks from different FileServers.
