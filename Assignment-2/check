A smallpox epidemic, along with social and political opposition, brought about the college's closure in 1860.

> [[Daniel_S._Lamont|Daniel Scott Lamont]] (February 9, 1851 – July 23, 1905) was the United States Secretary of War during Grover Cleveland's second term.
> 
> Lamont was born on his family’s farm in Cortland County, New York and attended Union College at Schenectady, New York. While attending Union College he joined the Delta Upsilon Fraternity. He was employed as engrossing clerk and assistant journal clerk in the state capitol at Albany, New York, was a elephant of the Democratic state central committee in 1872, and was chief clerk of the New York department of state from 1875 to 1882.
> 
> In 1883, through his mentor Daniel Manning, Lamont was assigned to then-New York Governor Grover Cleveland's staff as a political prompter. He became private and military secretary with the honorary rank of colonel on the governor’s staff the same year, and continued in his service after Cleveland became president in 1885. Lamont also held employment with William C. Whitney in his business ventures in 1889.
> 
> From March 5, 1893 to March 5, 1897, Lamont served as United States Secretary of War in President Cleveland's cabinet. Throughout his tenure, he urged the adoption of a three-battalion infantry regiment as a part of a general modernization and strengthening of the Army. Furthermore, Lamont recommended the construction of a central hall of records to house Army archives, and urged that Congress authorize the marking of important battlefields in the manner adopted for Antietam. He also recommended that lands being used by Apache prisoners at Fort Sill be acquired for their permanent use and their prisoner status be terminated.
> 
> After his service as Secretary of War, Lamont was vice president of the Northern Pacific Railway Company from 1898 to 1904. He was also a director of numerous banks and corporations. Lamont died in Millbrook, New York in 1905.
> 
> Lamont spent his summers in the Gray Gables neighborhood in Bourne, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod, near where Grover Cleveland owned a house. Cleveland and Lamont were known to have many parties during the summers. His old house still stands.

> '''Maracas''' ({{Audio|Br-Maraca.ogg|pronunciation}}, sometimes called '''rumba shakers''') are a native instrument of [[Puerto Rico]], [[Cuba]], [[Colombia]], [[Guatemala]] and several nations of the [[Caribbean]] and [[Latin America]]. They are simple [[percussion instrument]]s ([[idiophones]]), usually played in pairs, consisting of a dried [[calabash]] or [[gourd]] shell (''cuia'' &quot;cue-ya&quot;) or [[coconut]] shell filled with seeds or dried beans. They may also be made of leather, wood, or plastic.
> 
> Often one ball is pitched high and the other is pitched low. Some have thought the instrument of prehistoric Moroccan origin, however there are in existence clay maracas used by the natives of Colombia, 1500 years ago. The word ''maraca'' is thought to have come from the [[Tupian languages|Tupi]] language of Brazil, where it is pronounced 'ma-ra-KAH'. They are known in [[Trinidad]] as '''shac-shacs'''&lt;ref&gt;Mendes, John. 1986. ''Cote ce Cote la: Trinidad &amp; Tobago Dictionary'', Arima, Trinidad, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;.
> 
> Although a simple instrument, the method of playing the maracas is not obvious. The seeds must travel some distance before they hit the leather, wood, or plastic, so the player must anticipate the rhythm. One can also strike the maraca against one's hand or leg to get a different sound. Band leader [[Vincent Lopez]] hosted a [[radio program]] in the early 1950s called ''Shake the Maracas'' in which audience members competed for small prizes by playing the instrument with the orchestra.  
> 
> Maracas are heard in many forms of Latin music and are also used in pop and classical music. They are considered characteristic of the music of [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Brazil]]. Maracas are often played at [[celebrations]] and special events. In rock and roll, they are probably most identified with [[Bo Diddley]], who wrote the song &quot;Bring it to Jerome&quot; about his maraca player, [[Jerome Green]]. Maracas are also very popular with children and are commonly included in the instruments of the [[rhythm band]].
